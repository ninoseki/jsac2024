## Problem Statements

- Pros and cons in the Internet search engines, passive DNS/SSL services:
  - e.g. I can find CVE-xxx in X but not Y
- Data management (How do you manage search results?)
- Searching is boring and human error is inevitable

## Mihari Is to Rescue

- One Sigma-like rule to rule multiple services like the One Ring

## User's Voice

> Mihari is single-handedly one of the most helpful and versatile tools a CTI analyst can have in their toolkit and repertoire. It removes the complexity of needing to develop custom tooling, and provides a simple yet coherent mechanism through which to develop a collections programme leveraging services such as Censys, Shodan and VirusTotal. Combined with Shimon, **Mihari is the definitive tool for tracking malicious infrastructure**.
>
> Mihari’s extensible nature, including its API, ensures it remains flexible enough to integrate within existing analysis pipelines. Ultimately, Mihari can help reduce a CTI teams’ reliance on vendor IOC feeds, by allowing teams to rapidly develop and automate their own high-fidelity collections to meet specific organisational intelligence requirements and priorities.
